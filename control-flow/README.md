## Introduction

It would be nice if we could tell computers to make us the perfect sandwich, but that’s beyond what we can ask from our electronic friends right now. What we can do, however, is tell them to make decisions based on certain conditions using logic. You’d be surprised how much computers can get done just by comparing things to each other. Let’s see how that works.
