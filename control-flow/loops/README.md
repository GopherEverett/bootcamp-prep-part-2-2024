If you thought the delights of conditionals would be done in one go, think again. You can keep the fun going with **loops**. In programming, a loop will continue to execute as long as a certain condition is met.

We’ll cover two kinds of JavaScript loops here: `for` loops and `while` loops. They both get the job done, but we’ll learn which situations make the most sense for each kind.
