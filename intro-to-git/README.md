## Introduction

Making and saving changes to code might feel like playing a high-stakes game — one wrong move and it’s all over. But this actually isn’t true at all. Thankfully, enough developers have suffered through rewriting code that they invented the tools like Git to prevent such scenarios from ever happening.
