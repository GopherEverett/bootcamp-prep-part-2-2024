# Introduction to GitHub

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Sign up for GitHub and create an account.

## Creating a GitHub Account

To start, let’s head over to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>. The first thing we’ll do is create a username by clicking on the field in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.

The username you enter will be part of the GitHub URL for every site you host here, so choose something that’s easy to remember. Most people use their name, a pen name, or their company’s name. To simplify things, try to make your username one word and all lower case.

For this guide, we’re going to use “gasamplepage.” Please pick whatever username you like, for example “corneliusfinch123.” After selecting our username, we’ll add our email and make up a password. Then, we’ll click “Sign up for GitHub.”

If prompted on the following screen, select the “Free” option as your personal plan. It should be pre-selected; however, if it isn’t, make sure to click on it. Finally, hit the “Finish sign up” button.

## Basic Navigation: Repo Owner

This is what the GitHub interface looks like for a repository called awesome-project:

Repo Name and Owner describe who owns the repository, the name of the repository, and whether or not it is public or private.

Recall that we referred to Git-enabled directories as repositories or repos. That name applies to projects on GitHub as well.

## Basic Navigation: Overview

Overview displays the number of commits, branches, releases, and contributors to a particular repository. Selecting any one of these options will open a detailed view of your selection.

## Basic Navigation: Repository File Structure

Repository File Structure displays the contents of the repository. Selecting any file or directory will open a detailed view of that file and allow you to edit its content directly.
