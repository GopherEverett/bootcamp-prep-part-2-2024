## Learning Objective

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Explain the command line and why developers use it.

## Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?

Time to try out the command line on your own some more!

We’ve gone ahead and created a new directory for you called `world`. Download it <a href="https://ga-instruction.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/tech/accessing-and-navigating-the-cli/World.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

When you double-click on the zip file, it will create a new directory named `world` next to it in your `Downloads` directory.

Now that you can picture where the file is located, open a terminal window.

Use the command line to do the following:

* Navigate into your `Downloads` directory.
* Move into the `world` directory from the `Downloads` directory.
* List the contents of the `world` directory.
* One of the six continents within the `world` directory contains a hidden file, `.carmen_sandiego.png`. Using only the command line, find out where in the world — i.e., where in the directory structure — this fugitive file is hidden.

**Hint!** If you weren't able to find Carmen, make sure you're using the `ls -a` command.

Assuming `Documents` is a directory located within the working directory of the terminal, what does the command `ls -a Documents` do? 

<fieldset>
    <legend>Please select one of the following</legend>
    <input type='radio' name='answers' id='answer2' value='answer2' /><label for='answer2'>Changes into the Documents directory and lists all contents</label><br />
    <input type='radio' name='answers' id='answer3' value='answer3' /><label for='answer3'>Remains in the current directory and lists all contents of the Documents directory</label><br />
    <input type='radio' name='answers' id='answer4' value='answer4' correct="true"/><label for='answer4'>Remains in the current directory and lists only the non-hidden contents of the Documents directory</label><br />
    <input type='radio' name='answers' id='answer5' value='answer5' /><label for='answer5'>Changes into the Documents directory and lists its non-hidden contents</label><br />

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you accessed your computer’s command line interface (CLI) and started using it to navigate your computer. 

Like power tools, commands should be used only as directed. You are now speaking directly to your computer, and it’s possible to execute commands with unintended consequences if you type some seemingly random letters into your terminal. 

If you stick to using commands as instructed in the pre-work or in class, you’ll be safe.
