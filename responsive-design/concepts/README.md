**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to explain the concept of responsive design and understand its importance in modern web development.

## Background

While it's now in the distant past, building a successful online presence used to only mean ensuring that a website worked correctly on a few desktop browsers. The mobile internet looked like this:

Today, users are more likely to visit websites using a mobile browser than a desktop browser. Because of this, modern websites and applications are typically designed to work across many devices by utilizing responsive design.

## What is responsive design?

Responsive design is a technique for designing and developing websites and apps that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It allows us to create apps that feel at home on whatever device the app is viewed on. Specifically, the most critical criterion to respond to is the width of the device's screen.

When we implement responsive design, we also consider and accept the limitations of different devices. Making apps respond to mobile devices may mean exposing fewer features to mobile users. Similarly, building features designed for touch input will limit those features to devices with touch input.

Whether you're aware or not, you encounter examples of responsive design every time you use the internet! Common examples include things like:

- **Navbar responsiveness**: The navbar of a desktop site might be horizontal, with links spanning the width of the page, while a mobile site might have a hamburger menu that expands into a vertical list when clicked.
- **Image size**: Desktop sites can account for large image sizes, but mobile sites need smaller or adaptive images in order to fit the screen without any unintended cropping.

## Why implement responsive design?

Non-traditional interfaces have skyrocketed in popularity, and users access the web from all kinds of devices. Responsive design ensures that more people can use our applications to begin with. Furthermore, it enables them to have a positive experience using our apps, regardless of how they interact with them.

That's not to say there are no challenges to implementing responsive design. By its nature, implementing responsive design requires more planning, more code, and more testing. The benefits typically outweigh the challenges though, and it is an essential consideration for any website or app.
