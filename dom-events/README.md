# DOM Events

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Understand DOM events and their role in web page interactivity.
- Compose event listeners with appropriate syntax.
- Create in-memory elements and add them to the DOM. 

## Introduction

DOM Events are fundamental to creating interactive and responsive web experiences, serving as the backbone for user interaction within your web pages. In this lesson, we'll dive into how events can be used to detect and respond to user actions like clicks, key presses, and mouse movements. By understanding how to listen for and handle these events, you'll be able to execute JavaScript functions in response, thereby making your web applications dynamic and engaging.
