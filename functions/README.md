## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

* Define the concept of functions in JavaScript
* Create function declarations and expressions with appropriate syntax and naming conventions
* Declare and invoke functions with parameters and arguments
* Use the return statement and store returned values
* Understand what variables and functions a program has access to based on where it was declared

## Introduction

One of the best ways to create buggy code is to copy-paste a few lines of code across many files, then trying to update those lines consistently later. Luckily we have functions, or blocks of code you can run on command to perform a specific routine. Just call the function’s name and it comes running. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to wrap our reusable code into functions.

| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| [Concepts and Fundamentals](./concepts-and-fundamentals/README.md) |  Explain how JavaScript functions can simplify complex tasks and promote code reusability. |
| [Parameters and Arguments](./parameters-and-arguments/README.md)   | Declare a function with parameters and call a function using arguments.                    |
| [Return Values](./return-values/README.md)                         | Return data from functions using the `return` statement.                                   |
| [Scope](./scope/README.md)                                         | Clearly define lexical scope in JavaScript, illustrating its significance in structuring and accessing variables within code.                          |
| [Functions and Arrays](./functions-and-arrays/README.md)           | Combine to powerful tools in JavaScript.                                                   |
