# The DOM

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Explain how the DOM works.
- Find and read information from HTML elements using JavaScript.
- Update or remove HTML elements from the webpage.
- Create and add new HTML elements to the webpage.

## Introduction

The DOM acts as a bridge between your HTML content and the interactive powers of JavaScript, allowing you to dynamically manipulate web pages in real time. Throughout this lesson, you'll learn how the DOM structures an HTML document into a tree of objects that can be accessed and modified, making it possible for you to find, read, update, create, and even remove elements from the webpage on-the-fly - empowering you to build more interactive and responsive user experiences.
