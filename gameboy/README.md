## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

- Manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM): Understand and apply methods to select and modify HTML elements dynamically.
- Handle Events: Attach event listeners to HTML elements to handle user interactions like clicks, enabling interactive web applications.
- Implement Conditional Logic and Loops: Use JavaScript to control flow with conditions and iterate with loops to handle repetitive tasks efficiently.
- Organize JavaScript Code: Structure your JavaScript code into functions to make it reusable, readable, and easier to maintain.
- Debug and Test JavaScript Code: Use debugging techniques to identify and fix issues in your JavaScript code, enhancing reliability and functionality.

## Introduction

Imagine playing a classic Pokemon game where you can choose your Pokemon, battle against a computer-controlled opponent, and strategize between attacking or defending—all built by you using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project isn't just about reliving a slice of your childhood; it's a robust exercise in mastering JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

In this project, you will dive deep into creating dynamic interactions within a web page. You'll manipulate elements on the fly, respond to user inputs, and maintain the state of the game—all using pure JavaScript. This project is designed to mimic the dynamic nature of real-world web applications, challenging you to think about both the logic and structure of your code.

JavaScript's power lies in its ability to interact with HTML elements to create interactive and dynamic user experiences. You will learn to control these elements using the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows you to create, modify, or delete elements on your webpage dynamically. This practice mirrors the tasks of many JavaScript developers today—enhancing user interfaces and creating seamless interactions.

As you build this Pokemon battle game, keep in mind that each line of code is an opportunity to practice and refine your JavaScript skills. Whether you're defining variables, creating functions, or setting up event listeners, you're developing a foundation that will support all your future web development projects.

| [Initial Setup](./initial-setup/initial-setup.md)                                    | In the initial setup, students will link a JavaScript file to an HTML document and practice selecting elements from the DOM using document.querySelector. This foundational step is crucial for understanding how to interact with and manipulate web pages programmatically.              |
| [Part 1 - Game Start](./part1-game-start/part1-game-start.md)                        | This section focuses on starting the game by clearing the screen and rendering the initial Pokemon. Students will learn to manage game flow by adding and removing event listeners, and dynamically modify the DOM to update the user interface based on game logic.                       |
| [Part 2 - Selecting a Pokemon](./part2-selecting-pokemon/part2-selecting-pokemon.md) | Students will implement navigation through a Pokemon list using left and right buttons, adjusting global state variables and updating the display in real-time. This teaches essential skills in handling user inputs and dynamically responding to those inputs within a web application. |
| [Part 3 - Battle Setup](./part3-battle-setup/part3-battle-setup.md)                  | In this part, students set up the battle stage by choosing a Pokemon and preparing for the battle against a computer-selected opponent. They will apply skills in event handling, randomization, and DOM manipulation to transition from the selection stage to the battle interface.      |
| [Part 4 - Battle Mechanics](./part4-battle-mechanics/part4-battle-mechanics.md)      | Students will delve into the core battle mechanics, implementing turn-based actions that allow players to attack or defend. This section emphasizes using conditional logic, event-driven programming, and DOM updates to reflect the ongoing battle state and outcomes.                   |
